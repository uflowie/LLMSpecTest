## Specification for "Book Entry" Resource Creation Form and Data Grid

### **1. Resource Definition**

The resource will be a **Book**, which users can create entries for. Each book entry has five fields:

| Field            | Data Type | Validation Criteria                                    |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Title            | String    | Required, minimum 2 characters, maximum 100 characters |
| Author           | String    | Required, minimum 2 characters, maximum 60 characters  |
| ISBN             | String    | Required, numeric, exactly 13 digits (EAN-13 format)   |
| Publication Date | Date      | Required, cannot be in the future                      |
| Number of Pages  | Integer   | Required, integer, minimum value: 1, maximum: 5000     |

---

### **2. Form Specification**

The form used to create this resource must adhere to these requirements:

**Form Fields:**

* **Title:**

  * Text input field
  * Placeholder: "Enter book title"
  * Must display inline validation errors: "Title is required", "Title must be between 2 and 100 characters".

* **Author:**

  * Text input field
  * Placeholder: "Enter author name"
  * Must display inline validation errors: "Author is required", "Author name must be between 2 and 60 characters".

* **ISBN:**

  * Text input field
  * Placeholder: "Enter 13-digit ISBN number"
  * Must display inline validation errors: "ISBN is required", "ISBN must contain exactly 13 numeric digits".

* **Publication Date:**

  * Date picker input field
  * Must display inline validation errors: "Publication Date is required", "Publication Date cannot be in the future".

* **Number of Pages:**

  * Numeric input field (integer type)
  * Placeholder: "Enter number of pages"
  * Must display inline validation errors: "Number of Pages is required", "Number of pages must be between 1 and 5000".

**Form Submission:**

* The form must include a clearly marked submit button labeled "Add Book".
* Form validation must run immediately on input ("on blur" and "on change") and prior to submission.
* The submit button must be disabled whenever the form has validation errors.

---

### **3. Validation Logic Summary**

* **Title and Author**

  * Required fields, minimum and maximum length constraints enforced.
* **ISBN**

  * Numeric input enforced, exactly 13 characters long, digits only.
* **Publication Date**

  * Required; validation checks if the selected date is today or in the past only (future dates disallowed).
* **Number of Pages**

  * Integer field, with strict numerical range between 1 and 5000.

---

### **4. Data Grid (Entries Table)**

Below the form, display a **data grid** showing all Book entries stored in the database:

**Columns:**

* ID (auto-generated by the database)
* Title
* Author
* ISBN
* Publication Date (formatted as yyyy-mm-dd)
* Number of Pages

**Functional Requirements:**

* On successful form submission (no validation errors and successful POST):

  * The newly created entry must be added immediately to the top of the data grid.
  * Form fields must be cleared, ready for next entry.
* Data grid rows must display clearly, including visual formatting (e.g., alternating row colors, clear column separation).

---

### **5. UI/UX Considerations**

* Immediate, real-time validation feedback must be clearly visible to users.
* Submit button should visibly indicate disabled state when validation errors are present.
* User-friendly error messages clearly communicate issues and guidance for resolution.
* Data grid updates seamlessly upon valid form submissions, providing clear visual feedback that the entry has been recorded.

---

### **6. Technical Notes**

* **Backend:** Resource persistence should follow standard RESTful API practices. Each new entry receives an auto-generated ID from the backend upon successful database insertion.
* **Frontend:** Implement validation using JavaScript (e.g., React with a form library like Formik/Yup, Angular reactive forms, or Vue with Vuelidate) to ensure smooth and interactive user experience.
* **Database:** Entries stored persistently in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB), with backend API returning entries ordered by creation date (newest first).
